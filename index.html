        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            We started as a small group of neighbors who wanted to make a big difference. Over the years,
            volunteers and donors have helped us build safe water sources, teach hygiene, and support local maintenance.
            Our work is community-led, which means locals help design and care for every project.
        </p>

        <p>
            We believe that clean water changes everything â€” health, education, and opportunity. With simple,
            sustainable solutions we partner with villages to create long-lasting impact.
        </p>
